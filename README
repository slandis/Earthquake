# Earthquake/README
# Copyright (C) 2012 Shaun Landis

These scripts represent a small utility to use the earthquake data feed provided by the USGS and parse, store and
finally visualize the data via a graph displayed in HTML5. Follow the directions below, and modify and extend to
suit your needs. If you improve upon this application and would like to share the modifications, email me and I'll
merge the changes.

RGraph is not included -- You'll need to grab it from
http://www.rgraph.net/download, unzip it into /, then rename the 'RGraph'
folder to 'packages'.

SETUP
1 - Create the SQLite (version 3) database using the provided schema.sql file (ex: cat schema.sql | sqlite3 usgs.db)
2 - Edit the crontab file to reflect your local system regarding the directory where scrape.php and usgs.db reside,
	as well as the path to the php-cli binary.
3 - Install the crontab (crontab crontab)
4 - Hit /index.php in your browser to view the graph.

This application is nothing fancy, and provides very little value add; it is simply a utility I used to visualize
earthquake frequency in a given area. Use it at your own risk. There is no warranty, written or implied and I make
no guarantees regarding this application being fit for any particular use.
